C# Variables
Variables in C# are used to store data that can be manipulated throughout a program. Each variable has a type that determines what kind of data it can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or booleans.
Declaring Variables
To declare a variable in C#, you specify the data type followed by the variable name. The syntax is as follows:
dataType variableName;
Demonstrating variable declaration and initialization using Greek letter names, with the project name changed to "Beta Studio Props":
using System;

namespace BetaStudioProps
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Declaring and initializing variables
            int alpha = 10;          // Integer variable
            double beta = 20.5;     // Double variable
            string theta = "Hello";  // String variable

            // Using the variables
            Console.WriteLine("Alpha: " + alpha);
            Console.WriteLine("Beta: " + beta);
            Console.WriteLine("Theta: " + theta);
        }
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
int alpha = 10;: Declares an integer variable named alpha initialized with the value 10.
double beta = 20.5;: Declares a double variable named beta initialized with the value 20.5.
string theta = "Hello";: Declares a string variable named theta initialized with the text "Hello".
Console.WriteLine(...): These lines print the values of the variables to the console.
Running the Program
Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App project named "Beta Studio Props."
Replace the default code in Program.cs with the updated example above.
Run the program by clicking the "Start" button or pressing F5.
The console will display:
Alpha: 10
Beta: 20.5
Theta: Hello
C# Data Types
C# provides a rich set of data types that can be categorized into two main groups: value types and reference types. Each data type has its specific use cases and characteristics.
Value Types
Value types store data directly and include the following:
Integer Types:
int: 32-bit signed integer.
long: 64-bit signed integer.
short: 16-bit signed integer.
byte: 8-bit unsigned integer.
Floating-Point Types:
float: Single-precision 32-bit floating-point.
double: Double-precision 64-bit floating-point.
decimal: 128-bit precise decimal, suitable for financial calculations.
Boolean:
bool: Represents a true or false value.
Character:
char: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.
Reference Types
Reference types store a reference to the data rather than the data itself and include:
String:
string: Represents a sequence of characters.
Object:
object: The base type from which all other types derive.
Arrays:
Can hold multiple values of the same type.
Example Program Using Unique Variable Names
Here’s a simple example demonstrating different C# data types with unique variable names:
using System;

namespace BetaStudioProps
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Value types
            int uniqueInteger = 42;                // Integer
            double uniqueDouble = 3.14;            // Double
            bool uniqueBoolean = true;              // Boolean
            char uniqueCharacter = 'A';             // Character
            decimal uniqueDecimal = 99.99m;        // Decimal

            // Reference types
            string uniqueString = "Welcome to C#"; // String
            int[] uniqueArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // Array

            // Using the variables
            Console.WriteLine("Integer: " + uniqueInteger);
            Console.WriteLine("Double: " + uniqueDouble);
            Console.WriteLine("Boolean: " + uniqueBoolean);
            Console.WriteLine("Character: " + uniqueCharacter);
            Console.WriteLine("Decimal: " + uniqueDecimal);
            Console.WriteLine("String: " + uniqueString);
            Console.WriteLine("Array: " + string.Join(", ", uniqueArray));
        }
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
Value Types:
int uniqueInteger = 42;: An integer variable.
double uniqueDouble = 3.14;: A double variable.
bool uniqueBoolean = true;: A boolean variable.
char uniqueCharacter = 'A';: A character variable.

It focuses on presenting the data of seven students: Bilal, Basit, Baber, Khalid, Saad, Amaar, and Zarar. The program highlights Bilal as the top scorer in the Science subjects. The student names and their marks are displayed in a tabular format, providing a clear overview of their performance.
Code Example:
using System;

namespace AskariSchool
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Defining the student names and their marks in science subjects
            string[] studentNames = { "Bilal", "Basit", "Baber", "Khalid", "Saad", "Amaar", "Zarar" };
            int[,] marks = {
                { 95, 90, 98, 97, 99 }, // Bilal
                { 78, 82, 85, 80, 84 }, // Basit
                { 70, 75, 72, 74, 71 }, // Baber
                { 60, 65, 68, 62, 67 }, // Khalid
                { 88, 85, 90, 87, 89 }, // Saad
                { 72, 78, 80, 75, 77 }, // Amaar
                { 85, 88, 82, 90, 87 }  // Zarar
            };

            string[] subjects = { "Mathematics", "Physics", "Biology", "Computer", "Chemistry" };

            // Displaying the header
            Console.WriteLine("Marks of Students from Askari School Wah Cantt, Pakistan");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------");
            Console.WriteLine($"{"Name",-10} {"Mathematics",-12} {"Physics",-8} {"Biology",-8} {"Computer",-9} {"Chemistry",-9}");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------");

            // Displaying the marks for each student
            for (int i = 0; i < studentNames.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.Write($"{studentNames[i],-10}");
                for (int j = 0; j < subjects.Length; j++)
                {
                    Console.Write($"{marks[i, j],-12}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            // Highlighting Bilal as the top scorer
            Console.WriteLine("\nNote: Bilal is the TOP scorer in Science subjects.");
        }
    }
}
Output:
Marks of Students from Askari School Wah Cantt, Pakistan
--------------------------------------------------------
Name       Mathematics Physics  Biology  Computer Chemistry
--------------------------------------------------------
Bilal      95          90       98       97       99        
Basit      78          82       85       80       84        
Baber      70          75       72       74       71        
Khalid     60          65       68       62       67        
Saad       88          85       90       87       89        
Amaar      72          78       80       75       77        
Zarar      85          88       82       90       87        

Note: Bilal is the TOP scorer in Science subjects.

Subjects: We have an array to hold the names of the subjects (Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Computer, Chemistry).
Tabular Display: The program prints the student names and their corresponding marks in a formatted table.
Highlighting Bilal: A note is displayed at the end, emphasizing that Bilal is the top scorer in Science subjects.
Here’s another example of displaying the marks of students in a different format, focusing on presenting the top scorer in each subject.
Project Name: Askari School - Top Scorer by Subject
Project Description:
This project, Askari School - Top Scorer by Subject, displays the marks of students (Bilal, Basit, Baber, Khalid, Saad, Amaar, Zarar) in Science subjects from Askari School Wah Cantt, Pakistan. The program also identifies the top scorer in each subject, highlighting which student has the highest marks in Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Computer, and Chemistry.
Code Example:
using System;

namespace AskariSchool
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Defining the student names and their marks in science subjects
            string[] studentNames = { "Bilal", "Basit", "Baber", "Khalid", "Saad", "Amaar", "Zarar" };
            int[,] marks = {
                { 95, 90, 98, 97, 99 }, // Bilal
                { 78, 82, 85, 80, 84 }, // Basit
                { 70, 75, 72, 74, 71 }, // Baber
                { 60, 65, 68, 62, 67 }, // Khalid
                { 88, 85, 90, 87, 89 }, // Saad
                { 72, 78, 80, 75, 77 }, // Amaar
                { 85, 88, 82, 90, 87 }  // Zarar
            };

            string[] subjects = { "Mathematics", "Physics", "Biology", "Computer", "Chemistry" };

            // Displaying the header
            Console.WriteLine("Marks of Students from Askari School Wah Cantt, Pakistan");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------");
            Console.WriteLine($"{"Name",-10} {"Mathematics",-12} {"Physics",-8} {"Biology",-8} {"Computer",-9} {"Chemistry",-9}");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------------");

            // Displaying the marks for each student
            for (int i = 0; i < studentNames.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.Write($"{studentNames[i],-10}");
                for (int j = 0; j < subjects.Length; j++)
                {
                    Console.Write($"{marks[i, j],-12}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            // Finding and displaying top scorer for each subject
            Console.WriteLine("\nTop Scorer in Each Subject:");
            for (int subjectIndex = 0; subjectIndex < subjects.Length; subjectIndex++)
            {
                int topScore = 0;
                string topStudent = "";

                for (int studentIndex = 0; studentIndex < studentNames.Length; studentIndex++)
                {
                    if (marks[studentIndex, subjectIndex] > topScore)

Top Scorer in Each Subject:
Mathematics: Bilal with 95 marks
Physics: Bilal with 90 marks
Biology: Bilal with 98 marks
Computer: Bilal with 97 marks
Chemistry: Bilal with 99 marks
Explanation:
Finding Top Scorer: For each subject, the program iterates through all students' marks to find who scored the highest. This is done using a loop that compares marks for each subject.
Subjects Array: The subjects array contains the names of the subjects.
Marks Array: The marks array holds the marks of each student for each subject.
Output: The program first displays the marks of all students and then identifies the top scorer for each subject in a list.
Running the Program:
Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App project named "Askari School."
Replace the default code in Program.cs with the updated example above.
Run the program by clicking the "Start" button or pressing F5.
The output will show the marks of all students, followed by the top scorer in each subject.
Project Name: Pakistan Cities Population
Project Description:
The Pakistan Cities Population project displays the population of five major cities in Pakistan: Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Wah Cantt, and Attock. The program presents the population data in tabular form and identifies the city with the highest population.
Code Example:
using System;

namespace PakistanCitiesPopulation
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Defining the city names and their populations
            string[] cityNames = { "Islamabad", "Karachi", "Lahore", "Wah Cantt", "Attock" };
            int[] populations = { 1014825, 14910352, 12188000, 500000, 188000 };

            // Displaying the header
            Console.WriteLine("Population of Cities in Pakistan");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------");
            Console.WriteLine($"{"City",-12} {"Population",-10}");
            Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------");

            // Displaying the population for each city
            for (int i = 0; i < cityNames.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{cityNames[i],-12} {populations[i],-10}");
            }

            // Finding the city with the highest population
            int highestPopulation = populations[0];
            string highestCity = cityNames[0];

            for (int i = 1; i < cityNames.Length; i++)
            {
                if (populations[i] > highestPopulation)
                {
                    highestPopulation = populations[i];
                    highestCity = cityNames[i];
                }
            }

            // Displaying the city with the highest population
            Console.WriteLine("\nCity with the Highest Population:");
            Console.WriteLine($"{highestCity} with a population of {highestPopulation}");
        }
    }
}
Output:
Population of Cities in Pakistan
--------------------------------
City         Population
--------------------------------
Islamabad    1014825   
Karachi      14910352  
Lahore       12188000  
Wah Cantt    500000    
Attock       188000    

City with the Highest Population:
Karachi with a population of 14910352
Explanation:
City Data: The city names are stored in an array cityNames, and their corresponding populations are stored in the populations array.
Tabular Display: The program prints the city names and their respective populations in a formatted table.
Finding the Highest Population: A loop is used to compare the populations and find the city with the highest population.
Output: After displaying the table of populations, the program highlights the city with the highest population.
Running the Program:
Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App project named "Pakistan Cities Population."
Replace the default code in Program.cs with the updated example above.
Run the program by clicking the "Start" button or pressing F5.
The console will display the population of each city, followed by the city with the highest population.
